# Simple Calculator using Tkinter

## Overview
This project is a GUI-based calculator application developed using Python’s Tkinter library. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations through interactive buttons in a simple and attractive interface.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Decimal number support  
- Clear (C) button to reset input  
- Backspace button to delete the last character  
- Error handling for invalid expressions  
- Dark-themed user interface  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Tkinter (GUI library)  

## How the Application Works
- Button clicks insert numbers or operators into the display.  
- The `=` button evaluates the expression using Python’s `eval()` function.  
- The `C` button clears the entire input.  
- The Backspace button removes the last entered character.  
- Invalid expressions are handled gracefully without crashing the application.  

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.  
2. Save the file as `calculator.py`.  
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
4. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
